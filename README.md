# Cricket-Management-System
The Cricket Database Management System is a software application designed to efficiently manage all cricket-related activities. This project aids cricket organizations in systematically storing information about players, teams, matches, scores, stadiums, and more. The application specializes in cricket scheduling and includes features such as maintaining match schedules, team details, batting and bowling records, and player searches. Administrators have full authority to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, enabling them to add, update, or remove players, schedules, stadiums, scores, and other information as needed. Additionally, it allows for generating and printing detailed reports of players, teams, matches, scores, and venues. The system facilitates fetching match schedules along with venues and team squads, including selected players for upcoming matches. By automating the manual methods of managing cricket data, this application ensures systematic storage and quick access to information whenever required. Its primary goal is to streamline the management of cricket-related data, ensuring easy retrieval and organized storage of all details related to players, teams, matches, and grounds
